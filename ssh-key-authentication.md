# Setting Up SSH Key Authorization

## Step 1: Generate Public and Private Key

```sh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "system-identification-text"
```
## Step 2: Copy the public key to the remote system

### 1. Using the Command `ssh-copy-id`
   
```sh
ssh-copy-id username@server_address
```
### 2. Alternatively, You Can Manually Copy the Public Key

1. Copy the public key text from the id_rsa.pub file available on your local system (`/home/gautham/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`).

2. Now, paste the copied text into the `authorized_keys` file on the remote system: (`/home/gautham/.ssh/authorized_keys`).

## Note : Setting Up Key Authorization If You Have a Gateway System.
1. You need to copy the same public key generated by the `ssh-keygen` command to both the gateway and final remote systems to use key authorization.
2. To do this, copy the public key text into the `.ssh/authorized_keys` file available in your home directory.
